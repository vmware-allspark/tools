# protoc-gen-alias

`protoc-gen-alias` is a plugin for protoc which type alias for all messages, such that one protobuf definition can
be consumed from many Go packages

## Usage

Usage is typically through `buf`, but you can use directly.
See `test/Makefile` for example usage.

## Configuration

The plugin looks for a comment like `+cue-gen:Simple:versions:v1,v1alpha` on the package.
This will generate aliases to the current version, for all versions listed (the current version is ignored).

## Examples Of Generated Code

```go
// Code generated by protoc-gen-jsonshim. DO NOT EDIT.
type Simple = v1.Simple
type Simple_Name = v1.Simple_Name
type Simple_Number = v1.Simple_Number
type SimpleWithMap = v1.SimpleWithMap
type SimpleWithMap_Nested = v1.SimpleWithMap_Nested
type ReferencedMap = v1.ReferencedMap
type ImportedReference = v1.ImportedReference
```
